Complied:Java, C#, TypeScript -> more rules and lots of exceptions and errors


Visual Studio Code: This is a Code Editor comonly used for JS
Intellij IDEA : This is mostly for Java and Kotilon

These code editors are known as IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

Example : "John: + 45 --> John45

when used between number and string = concatenation
